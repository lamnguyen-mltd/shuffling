record_history 

There are three phases to record the training process history. 
The result will be recorded in a dictionary named statistics.
phase 'initial': set up the dictionary statistics at the beginning
phase 'measure': called each time we want to record the data to the dictionary
phase 'save'   : save the dictionary when complete training. We can modify to save the weight.
